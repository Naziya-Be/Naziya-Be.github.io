# Dodge the Creeps - Modified Version 

This project is based on the official **Godot "Dodge the Creeps" tutorial game**.  
I completed the tutorial and then added modifications as required for the assignment.

---

## Base Game
The base game has the following features:
- Player can move around the screen.
- Mobs spawn and move in random directions.
- The goal is to survive as long as possible while avoiding mobs.
- HUD displays score and game messages.

## Modifications Made
I modified the game beyond the tutorial as follows:

1. **PowerUps**
   - Added a new **PowerUp collectible (blue icon)**.
   - When the player touches a PowerUp:
     - The PowerUp disappears.
     - Player instantly gains **+5 points**.
     - HUD shows `"Power Up!"`.

2. **Difficulty Scaling**
   - Added a system where the game becomes harder over time.
   - Mobs spawn faster and move quicker as difficulty increases.
   - HUD shows `"Difficulty Up!"` to notify the player.

3. **HUD Improvements**
   - Custom HUD messages added for **PowerUps** and **Difficulty changes**.
   - This gives the player clear feedback during gameplay.
